# Star-Catalogue
University project for the University of Manchester. Using C++ I built a program that creates and stores astronomical objects, like: blackholes, galaxies, stars and planets. As well as performing basic calculations with them.

The programs demonstrates the use of:
-  Class Hierarchy and Inheritance:
-   Virtual Functions and Polymorphism
-   Object Creation and Memory Management
-   Encapsulation and Data Protection
